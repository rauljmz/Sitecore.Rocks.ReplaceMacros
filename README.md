Sitecore Rocks - Replace Macros
=================

Adds a new entry to the Tools contextual menu so you can replace initial value tokens ($name, $date, etc) on items that were created before the tokens were inserted in the standard values.


To install you can just compile the project and change the build path to the plugin folder of your local rocks folder (you can get that from the Sitecore Rocks initial screen, Get Started, Sitecore Rocks, Open Sitecore Rocks user folder in Windows Explorer). Typically:
C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Sitecore\Sitecore.RocksExp\Plugins\ReplaceMacros\cd
